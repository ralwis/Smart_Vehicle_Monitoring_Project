# Smart_Vehicle_Monitoring_Project
This project gives access to vehicle statuses like speed, duration, and other features from anywhere. The vehicle status gets as input from sensors and microcontrollers (NodeMCU and Arduino Uno). These values are sent to firebase by using WiFi and the users can access the real-time sensor values from the web app.
